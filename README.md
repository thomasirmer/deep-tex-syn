# Parametric models for texture
 
This repository contains the code for texture synthesis using CNN models


List of things to do:

	1. Texture experiments:
		1. DTD, FMD, KTH-2b datasets
		2. MIT Indoor, PASCAL VOC 2007
	2. Texture synthesis:
	 	1. Learn weights for various layers using a dataset of texture samples (take multiple crops and learn weights).
	 	2. Comparison of patch-based methods for texture synthesis
	3. Texture modification
		1. Constrained optimization problems with decribable attributes for editing the textures.
